# A classic fun and challenging game
Snake game is a classic game, in which a player can use arrow keys to control a snake to eat food. The food helps snake grow and player can get higher score.
When the snake hits the wall or its head collides with its tail, game is over. The game is developed with the design of Object Oriented Programming (OOP),
where snake, food and scoreboard objects are created for specific attributes and methods. The classes are defined by inheriting from Python Turtle class.
